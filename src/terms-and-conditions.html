We do not give medication outside hours i.e. between 8pm and 8am. We do not administer any form of injection. We will administer eye drops and ear drops as long as it doesn’t cause stress to the pet. If you feel it will be stressful for them then you should arrange other care for them in your home.  <br>‍<br>If your pet becomes ill during their stay we will first try to contact you, failing this we will call and take them to the vets. We reserve the right to take your pets to the vets without your consent for any reason, including weight gain or weight loss, at your cost. <br>‍<br>If you do not collect your pet after one week from the collection date and no contact has been made, we will report you and rehome your pet.<br>‍<br>Bedding and toys are optional and it is at the owners’ risk.
